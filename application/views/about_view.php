		BirthdayBash.com is a basic online store used for birthday celebrations, and their About Us page goes above and beyond. 
		Not only do they have the standard company history, but they also include the history of the
		Ghurka soldiers they’re named after, a detailed dissection of their logo and in-depth information
		about their manufacturing. Of course, not every store calls for such a robust About Us,but
		since this company’s inspiration is steeped in Himalayan history, this is an instance where it works very well.
